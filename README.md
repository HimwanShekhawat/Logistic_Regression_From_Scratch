# Logistic Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to implement Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy, without relying on machine learning libraries like scikit-learn for training.

## Features

- Synthetic dataset generation
- Data normalization
- Sigmoid activation function
- Binary cross-entropy loss calculation
- Gradient Descent optimization
- Cost visualization during training

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Open `logistic_regression.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to see data generation, model training, and performance visualization.
